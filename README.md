## About

Milestone Project One / User Centric Development / Code Institute

This is a web site for a fictitious gym fulfilling the requirements for Milestone I project. The premise of the site is to put the gym in the best light
possible and motivate the visitor of the site to fill out a form registering their interest in the gym. To that end, there are cool photos and descriptions
of various part of the gym as well as motivational sentences and photos in the carousel.

## UX Functionality and Navigation

#### UX
- The site is using three different Google fonts:
1. **Archivo** for all headings and buttons
2. **Open Sans** for the the body text
3. **Faster One** for the text part of the logo. A note about this. I initially had the torso image as the logo and the name of the gym was next to it using this font. 
However, because of a span used for the letters "Abs" to make them the colour #aa0f0f, it was wreaking havoc to responsiveness. So I ultimately decided to combine 
the torso and gym name into one logo image file. I did leave the code in (commented out of course) to show what I attempted.

- The primary them colours are:
1. #aa0f0f
2. #000000
3. #ffffff

- Secondary colours:
1. #59626a

#### Functionality and Navigation
The site is a one page site where the 4 menu items takes you to different sections of the page with the navbar navigating to each of the sections. The sections are:

- **Home** - takes you to the top of the page and consists of a navbar and carousel images. There are 3 carousel images and each has a call to action 
taking you to the the "Become a Member Today!" form.
- **Facility** - takes you to the section under the carousel. This has icons highlighting facility itself as well as services the gym offers. After that
there is are photos of a couple of different areas of the gym with a blurb about about each section and a CTA underneath each blurb. If you highlight the
CTA you see a cool effect where the text becomes a button.
- **Classes** - this is similar to the "Facility" section in that there are a couple of photos and blurbs talking about classes the gym offers. And again, a CTA for each.
- **Personal Trainers** - as with the previous two sections there are photos, a blurb and a CTA for each. Obviously, this is talking about the gyms personal
training staff.

In addition, every section has a CTA which takes you to the "Become a Member Today!" section in order to fill out a form and submit it to the gym's email account. 
There is no email hooked up to this application.

## Technologies

#### Languages Libraries

- [HTML5](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/ "HTML5 Official Site")

- [CSS3](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/ "Cascading Style Sheets Official Site")

- [Bootstrap - v4.4.1](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/ "Bootstrap Official Site")


## Other Resources

I looked a various websites -- in particular, gym websites -- in order to get ideas for the general look and feel of the website. 
I looked at at least 5 sites and determined what I thought looked good and what inspired me to want to join that gym. 

As always, for technical reference and help, I used the following sites.
- https://getbootstrap.com/
- https://www.w3schools.com/
- https://stackoverflow.com/


## Potential Enhancements

There is immense potential improvement to this site. Some that come to mind are:

- Sticky navbar. I tried and tried, but the way I have designed my navbar, I was getting bizarre behaviour. Normall I would work persevere but I am running out
of time to submit this project.
- A dynamic widget that appears as you scroll down the page that when clicked, will take you to the top
- Email behind the form. It is just a blank for for the sake of fulfilling the project requirements. Upon submission, it does pop up a modal thanking the visitor
for their interest in joining the gym.
- Blog and testimonials


## Testing

#### Tools and Methods Used for Testing

- [HTML Validation](https://validator.w3.org/ "W3C Markup Validation Service")
- [CSS Validation](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ "CSS Validation Service")
- Chrome Developer Tools
- Spreadsheet submitted with project was used as a checklist of all that was tested.


## Deployment

- Used GitHub Pages to deploy the final version (https://mrbrown2207.github.io/mrbmsII/).

## Credits

#### Content

- All written content is bespoke and created by the code author (Michael Brown).
- Photo images used are images that I purchased and have rights to use in any project.
- All icons in the Facility section are icons that I purchased and have rights to use in any project. As a side note, each icon was created from 2 icons: the circle
and the image inside it.
- The image part of the logo (the torso) was created by: <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/authors/eucalyp" title="Eucalyp">Eucalyp</a> from <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/" title="Flaticon">www.flaticon.com</a>. This credit is also put in the footer at the bottom of the page. I did change the colour of the lines in the abdomen 
to match the dark-ish red that I use throughout the site. This is a "brand" colour if you will.
